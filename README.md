# Property Pulse - House Price Prediction
##This project predicts house prices in Bangalore using a machine learning model.

--> Develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features.
--> Explore and analyze relevant datasets to identify key factors influencing house prices.
--> Implementing feature scaling techniques to enhance and improve the accuracy of the model.
--> Provide a user-friendly interface to users to input property details and receive the predicted house price.


## Project Plan

* Data Collection : Gather a comprehensive dataset including property features, location data, and historical prices.
* Data Preprocessing : Clean and preprocess data, handling missing values and outliers.
* Feature Engineering : Identify key features affecting house prices and engineer new features if necessary.
* Model Selection and Training : Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g. linear regression, random forest, decision tree) and train the model using historical data.
* Evaluation : Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Deployment : Develop a user-friendly interface for the house price prediction model.

In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bangalore and created a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction. We began by collecting and preprocessing the dataset, followed by training a Linear Regression model and evaluating its performance. Using Flask, we built a web application to input house features and obtain predictions, making the model accessible to non-technical users. The project is thoroughly documented with a README.md, ensuring ease of understanding and replication. Future enhancements could include experimenting with more complex models, adding additional features, and deploying the application on a cloud platform for wider access.
